# rooted-bold-reading
The problem with existing situations is that they sound very stop-starty (I me-an tal-king li-ke th-is se-ems sil-ly). I have a theory that this kind of text enhancement software would work better if only the root of the word was bolded, thus drawing the eye from meaning-critical segment to meaning-critical segment, with the de-emphasized parts adding more information (**so** that **read**ing **go**es more **like** this, which **make**s **read**ing more **natur**al).

## For future me:
`nltk.stem` (https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.html) and specifically `nltk.stem.snowball` (https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.snowball.html) looked good.
I know it's a simple project but if you can get it to work for EPUBs, then it's feature-complete.
